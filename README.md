# vanilla-js-calculator

A simple 4-function calculator implemented using plain-old vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It recognizes keyboard shortcuts for quick calculations and displays the current state of the calculatorâ€™s memory below the interface. This project was undertaken as an exercise in breaking away from my reliance on frontend frameworks like jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap.
